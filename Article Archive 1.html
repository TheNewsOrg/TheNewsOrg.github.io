                    School's ending soon. It's been a good year. When school
                    ends I
                    can
                    play more minecraft, so thats good. I'm building a moss
                    farm.
                    Waterlogged pistons are amazing! While we're on the topic of
                    Bedrock
                    exclusives, dying trees are good. They give you vines
                    without
                    having
                    to find a swamp.
