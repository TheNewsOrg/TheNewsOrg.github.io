It's 2024. I'm having fun watching videos and sometimes coding things. I just setup Arch Linux (btw) in a VM. I'm using KDE Plasma as the DE. I've been hearing really great things about it, and I would be able to experience them, only I need to give it more RAM. I need a new computer really. I'm using a Lenovo Thinkpad T430. I did add a GTX 1070 for graphical work, but I can't directly use it in a VM I think. I do have some computers I could use as test benches, but I need to buy some SSDs.
